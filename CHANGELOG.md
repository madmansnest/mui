## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Japanese and multibyte character input support:
  - Full UTF-8 input handling in Insert mode via IME
  - Proper display width calculation for CJK characters (East Asian Width)
  - Cursor position correctly accounts for double-width characters
  - UTF-8 byte sequence assembly in terminal adapter
- Plugin system:
  - `Mui.use "gem_name"` to declare plugin gems
  - Lazy gem installation via `bundler/inline` on editor startup
  - Class-based plugins: `class MyPlugin < Mui::Plugin`
  - DSL-based plugins: `Mui.define_plugin(:name) { ... }`
  - Plugin API: `command`, `keymap`, `autocmd`
  - Plugin dependencies with topological sort for load order
  - CommandContext for plugin access to editor internals
- Autocmd event system:
  - 10 events: BufEnter, BufLeave, BufWrite, BufWritePre, BufWritePost, ModeChanged, CursorMoved, TextChanged, InsertEnter, InsertLeave
  - Pattern matching for file paths (e.g., `"*.rb"`)
  - `Mui.autocmd :BufEnter, pattern: "*.rb" do |ctx| ... end`
- Custom commands:
  - `Mui.command :name do |ctx| ... end`
  - Execute via `:name` in command mode
- Custom keymaps:
  - `Mui.keymap :normal, "key" do |ctx| ... end`
  - Per-mode key bindings
- Configuration file support:
  - `~/.muirc` for global settings
  - `.lmuirc` for local (per-project) settings
  - Local settings override global settings
  - Ruby DSL format: `Mui.set :colorscheme, "theme_name"`
- Color scheme system:
  - 256-color terminal support
  - Built-in themes: `mui` (default), `solarized_dark`, `solarized_light`, `monokai`, `nord`, `gruvbox_dark`, `dracula`, `tokyo_night`
  - Customizable UI elements: normal text, status line, search highlight, visual selection, line numbers, messages
- Search functionality:
  - `/` to search forward (supports regular expressions)
  - `?` to search backward (supports regular expressions)
  - `n` to jump to next match (respects search direction)
  - `N` to jump to previous match (reverses search direction)
  - Wrap-around search (continues from beginning/end of file)
  - Search match highlighting across visible lines
- Undo/Redo functionality:
  - `u` to undo last change
  - `Ctrl-r` to redo undone change
  - Vim-compatible undo granularity: Insert mode session as single undo unit
  - Support for all editing operations (insert, delete, change, visual mode operations)
  - Maximum 1000 undo history entries
- Vim-compatible named registers:
  - Named registers (`"a` - `"z`): 26 user-specified registers
  - Unnamed register (`""`): Default register
  - Yank register (`"0`): Stores last yank, not affected by delete
  - Delete history registers (`"1` - `"9`): Stores delete history, shifts on each delete
  - Black hole register (`"_`): Discards content without saving
  - Usage: `"ayy` (yank to register a), `"ap` (paste from register a)
- Delete/change operators now save to registers (Vim-compatible behavior):
  - `dd`, `dw`, etc. save deleted text to unnamed register and delete history
  - `cc`, `cw`, etc. save changed text to unnamed register and delete history
  - Visual mode `d`/`c` also save to registers
- Yank operator (`y`):
  - `yy` to yank current line
  - `y` + motion: `yw`, `ye`, `yb`, `y0`, `y$`, `ygg`, `yG`
  - `yf{char}`, `yt{char}`, `yF{char}`, `yT{char}` to yank to/till character
  - `y` in Visual mode to yank selection (character-wise and line-wise)
  - `yw` behaves like `ye` (yanks to end of word) matching Vim behavior
- Paste commands:
  - `p` to paste after cursor (character-wise) or below current line (line-wise)
  - `P` to paste before cursor (character-wise) or above current line (line-wise)
  - Multi-line character-wise paste support
- Register system for yank/paste operations
  - Default register for storing yanked text
  - Named registers support
  - Linewise flag to distinguish line-wise vs character-wise yanks
- TerminalAdapter abstraction layer for custom terminal implementations
  - `Mui::TerminalAdapter::Base` abstract base class defining the terminal interface
  - `Mui::TerminalAdapter::Curses` default implementation using Curses library
  - Users can create custom adapters by subclassing `Base` and passing to `Editor.new(adapter:)`
  - Example: `Mui::Editor.new(file_path, adapter: MyCustomAdapter.new)`
- Initial release of Mui, a Vim-like text editor written in Ruby
- Vim-like modal editing with five modes:
  - Normal mode: Navigation and text manipulation
  - Insert mode: Text input
  - Command mode: Ex commands
  - Visual mode (`v`): Character-wise selection
  - Visual Line mode (`V`): Line-wise selection
- Basic cursor movement with `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` and arrow keys in Normal mode
- Arrow key cursor movement in Insert mode
- Motion commands:
  - Word movements: `w` (word forward), `b` (word backward), `e` (word end)
  - Line movements: `0` (line start), `^` (first non-blank), `$` (line end)
  - File movements: `gg` (file start), `G` (file end)
  - Character search: `f{char}`, `F{char}`, `t{char}`, `T{char}`
- Text editing operations:
  - `i` to insert before cursor
  - `a` to append after cursor
  - `o` to open new line below
  - `O` to open new line above
  - `x` to delete character at cursor
  - Backspace to delete and join lines
- Delete operator (`d`):
  - `dd` to delete current line
  - `d` + motion: `dw`, `de`, `db`, `d0`, `d$`, `dgg`, `dG`
  - `df{char}`, `dt{char}`, `dF{char}`, `dT{char}` to delete to/till character
  - `d` in Visual mode to delete selection (character-wise and line-wise)
- Change operator (`c`):
  - `cc` to change current line (clear and enter Insert mode)
  - `c` + motion: `cw`, `ce`, `cb`, `c0`, `c$`, `cgg`, `cG`
  - `cf{char}`, `ct{char}`, `cF{char}`, `cT{char}` to change to/till character
  - `c` in Visual mode to change selection (character-wise and line-wise)
  - `cw` behaves like `ce` (changes to end of word, preserving space) matching Vim behavior
- Ex commands:
  - `:w` to save file
  - `:w <filename>` to save as
  - `:q` to quit (with unsaved changes protection)
  - `:q!` to force quit
  - `:wq` to save and quit
  - `:e` to reload current file
  - `:e <filename>` to open file (Vim-compatible: non-existent files open as new buffer)
- Curses-based terminal UI with:
  - Buffer management
  - Window with scrolling support
  - Status line display
  - Command line input
- Visual mode features:
  - Selection highlighting with reverse video
  - Toggle between Visual and Visual Line mode with `v`/`V`

  - Exit to Normal mode with `Esc`
- Comprehensive test suite for `Mui::Input` and `Mui::Editor` classes
  - Unit tests for Buffer, CommandLine, Input, Screen, Window, Selection, and Editor modes
  - Integration tests for component interactions
  - E2E tests with ScriptRunner DSL for Vim operation scenarios including Visual mode
- Test infrastructure with Curses mock and `MuiTestHelper` module

### Changed
- Reorganized test directory structure to follow standard gem conventions
  - Unit tests moved to `test/mui/`
  - Editor mode tests in `test/mui/editor/`
  - Integration tests in `test/integration/`
  - E2E tests in `test/e2e/`
- Refactored test files to use nested classes per method for better readability
