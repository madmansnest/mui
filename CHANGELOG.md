## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed search returning "Pattern not found" after switching buffers via `:e`
  - `execute_search` was using `@buffer` (initial buffer) instead of `buffer` method (current buffer)
  - Now correctly searches in the current buffer after buffer switch
- Search highlight now recalculates correctly when switching buffers via `:e`
  - Previously, search highlight from old buffer remained visible in new buffer
  - Now calls `find_all_matches` on buffer switch to recalculate matches (Vim-compatible behavior)
  - Search pattern is preserved, only match positions are updated for new buffer content
- Improved Escape key response time in Insert mode
  - Set `ESCDELAY = 10` to reduce escape sequence detection delay from 1000ms to 10ms
  - Use `timeout = 0` instead of `nodelay` for `getch_nonblock`
- Insert mode completion now closes when pressing Left/Right arrow keys
  - Previously, arrow keys would move cursor but completion popup remained open
  - Now matches Vim behavior: completion closes on cursor movement
- Undo/Redo now works correctly for buffers opened via `:e`, `:sp`, `:vs`, `:tabnew`
  - Previously, buffers opened with these commands had no UndoManager set
  - Each buffer now gets its own UndoManager (Vim-compatible: independent undo history per buffer)
  - Handlers now use dynamic `undo_manager` reference to support buffer switching
- Fixed screen remnants after `:e` command when new file has fewer lines
  - Previously, lines from the old buffer would remain visible below the new content
  - Now explicitly clears lines beyond buffer content during render
- Fixed background color not applied to lines beyond buffer content
  - Previously, when opening a file with fewer lines than the visible height, lines beyond buffer were rendered without background color (transparent)
  - Now uses `put_with_style` with `:normal` color scheme to ensure consistent background color
- Plugin commands now appear in command completion suggestions
  - Previously, commands registered via `Mui.command` were not shown in Tab completion
  - `CommandCompleter` now includes plugin commands from `Mui.config.commands`

### Changed
- Reorganized test directory structure to follow standard gem conventions
  - Unit tests moved to `test/mui/`
  - Editor mode tests in `test/mui/editor/`
  - Integration tests in `test/integration/`
  - E2E tests in `test/e2e/`
- Refactored test files to use nested classes per method for better readability
- Improved syntax highlighting performance:
  - Use `\G` anchor for position-specific regex matching to avoid substring allocation
  - Pre-compile all regex patterns as class-level constants for one-time compilation at class load
  - Optimize event sorting in line renderer using array tuples instead of hash arrays
  - Add style resolution cache to avoid repeated hash merges
  - Reduce hash lookups in token cache by inlining cache validation
- Improved buffer change detection performance:
  - Added `Buffer#change_count` for O(1) change detection
  - Replaced `buffer.lines.hash` (O(n)) with counter comparison in `TextChanged` event trigger
- Improved buffer word completion performance:
  - Use `String#scan` with regex for fast word extraction instead of character-by-character iteration
  - Direct ASCII code comparison for word character detection instead of regex match per character

### Fixed
- Command-line completion Tab behavior:
  - First Tab now confirms current selection without cycling to next candidate
  - Second Tab and subsequent presses cycle through candidates
  - Previously, first Tab would skip the initially displayed candidate
- Command-line completion cursor position:
  - Cursor now moves to end of buffer after applying completion
  - Previously, cursor remained at old position after completion
- Plugin keymap handler now correctly uses active window's buffer instead of initial buffer
  - Fixes issue where buffer-specific keymaps didn't work in split windows
- Plugin keymap handler now properly returns handler result
  - Allows buffer-specific keymaps to conditionally pass through to built-in handlers
- Plugin keymap now correctly handles Enter key (Curses::KEY_ENTER)
  - Previously special key codes like Curses::KEY_ENTER (343) were not converted to keymap string
  - Now Enter key variants (CR, LF, KEY_ENTER) are all mapped to `"\r"` for plugin keymaps
- Auto-indent on newline in Insert mode
  - Pressing Enter preserves indentation from the current line
  - Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) is automatically inserted on the new line
  - Whitespace-only lines are cleared when pressing Escape (Vim behavior)
- Register is now shared globally across tabs and split windows
  - Yank in one tab/window can be pasted in another
  - Previously each ModeManager had its own Register instance
- Visual mode operations now correctly use the active window's buffer
  - Fixed yank/delete/change/indent operations using stale buffer reference after tab or window switch
  - Operations now properly target the current active window's buffer
- Command mode cursor movement with arrow keys
  - Left/Right arrow keys now move cursor within command line
  - Previously arrow keys were interpreted as characters (e.g., Left inserted 'a')
  - Backspace now deletes character before cursor position
  - Character input now inserts at cursor position
- Empty command (`:` then Enter) no longer crashes
  - Previously caused error when trying to look up empty string as plugin command
- Buffer word completion now works correctly after opening files with `:e` or `:tabe`
  - `InsertMode` now uses active window's buffer for `BufferWordCache` instead of initial buffer
  - Previously, completion would use stale buffer reference after switching files
